Update 0.3.4 March 2020 patch

Bug Fixes:
Animations now stop when an enemy is killed.
Fixed portal duplication bug
Fixed not teleporting to correct overworld nexus portal if chunks not loaded
Reduced lighting errors in structures and in the Nexus dimension

Changes:
The invasion time for the tower has been changed to minutes.
The invasion time no longer is dependent on the server tick, so it will be more accurate.
    ***IMPORTANT*** For modpack developers, this does affect all current world and configs. You'll have to 
    change or delete your config if you plan on making any new worlds, and for existing worlds,
    this means that towers will spawn quicker than expected. You may want to wait until the tower appears
    before updating to this new version.
To reduce lag in the Nexus, the time of day has been frozen, and the lighting is flatter
Maelstrom mobs now have a unique death animation

Update 0.3.3: Febuary 2020 patch

Fixed naming on a few items (previous has .name appended to them)
Previously portals mean to work in the Nexus dimension didn't work in the overworld. This has been changed so that they will work in any dimension. Going back through the same portal will go to the Nexus dimension.
If the Nexus portal has not been created by the monolith, going back to the overworld will no longer take a long time to load.
The fog in the cliff dimension looked weird when looking down at the swamp. This will no longer be the case.
There are a few other fog/weather changes. The clouds have been lowered a bit, and the fog extends upward beyond y=260 (before it stopped)
Animations sometimes went out of sync when the player wasn't looking directly at it. This is only noticeable for longer animations, but now this is no longer the case.
Certain particles such as in the Dark Nexus dimension and from certain staves would not appear on minimal particle settings. The most essential particles now appear in every setting.
The Fracture Golem and Cliff Golem quake attacks move a bit slower
