Theme: Black and red, nether hell inferno castle.

LEVEL 1 THE MAELSTROM GENERATOR:
    The player finds themselves in a massive cave, where in the center is a massive cylindrical contraption, which represents an engineering complex.
        The story behind this is that the maelstrom have punctured though bedrock to get to the maelstrom energy source down below.
    The void will be visible, and there will be bridges from the cylinder to islands, and rooms in the wall.
    There will be towers that hang from the ceiling.
    Include airships, drills, prisons (for villagers and maelstrom henchmen)
    Most of this stuff will be static, but we could consider making the main gear shafts actual entities that move (we can model this)
    We could consider adding other gadges, like lazers and stuff.
    There will be a lot of redstone contraptions.
    The mobs here will be engineers, maelstrom knights, and overseers. The goal here is to find the key fragments to unlock the next layer of the dungeon.
    Most blocks will be minecraft blocks, but the door will be unblockable.
    Takes about 100 Blocks
    Level (3.0)

Level 3 THE ROYAL CASTLE:
    The castle holds the strongest knights and mages. Fight or sneak your way though the tower to encounter the main boss, which will take an 15-45 mins to defeat.

First two levels will be a long hallway with a door at the end that requires three keys. The three keys will be rendered on a pedestal guarded by hordes of mob spawners.

Second two levels will also have three keys but these are held by tough bosses. It will not be a bunch of hallways, but a bunch of similarly sized rooms that is closer
to a maze.

Final levels will be closer to a tower format where the player has to ascend 5 or more smaller levels, and at the top is the megaboss, which is a fight that hopefully takes 
at least 10 - 15 mins. And the boss should have at least 8 unique attacks and two phases.

This whole structure should take at least a few hours to clear, just like the previous two dimensions. We need to have really strong mobs (maybe have the same mobs but 
with different levels)

What the experience will be:
I want it to feel like the player is making progress somehow. So use multiple levels that look slightly different.
Dungeon blocks will be unbreakable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| Story ideas

Herobrine cares for Minecraft, although is excuse is that the maelstrom are more of a nusiance than he is, and that is
unacceptable. He is also embarrased that he has to ask the player to help him because he doesn't have the freedom and
artificial intelligence to do so. 

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| Far out ideas
Final boss takes literally an entire hour to defeat - with a story that personally speaks to what minecraft means to me.
Research minecraft village to see how they generate those villages
